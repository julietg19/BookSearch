# Google Books Search

### Overview

In this activity, I created a new React-based Google Books Search app. This assignment required that I create React components, work with helper/util functions, and utilize React lifecycle methods to query and display books based on user searches. I also used Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save books to review or purchase later.
